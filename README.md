# RandomQuoteApp

A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/tom_o/pen/dGjyqW.

 Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELoPJ.

User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

I also included the ability to add and delete quotes,. These are stored in localStorage and therefore do not delete from the browser unless specifically deleted. You can also tweet a quote. The design should be reasonably responsive too.
