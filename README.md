## Objective

Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELoPJ.

USer story

  * click a button to show me a new random quote.
  * press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Add and remove quotes and keep them even when power is off
I decided to make the spec more difficult and intresting by also includeding the ability to add and delete quotes. These are stored in localStorage and therefore do not delete from the browser unless specifically deleted. 

## Tweetable quotes
You can also tweet a quote. 


## A responsive design
The design should be reasonably responsive and be suitable for use on a desktop wallpaper if a screen dump were taken by the user.
